1. First install Fink:
http://www.finkproject.org/download/srcdist.php
per the link above, use the .tool script to run Fink installation automatically after jdk is installed,
the .tool script is called install_fink.tool in this directory
2. Then install atlas using fink following the instruction:

http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html#compilation

In the following specific orders:
Dependencies via homebrew

4. First, we need to modify something..

brew edit opencv
Replace the following lines

args << "-DPYTHON#{py_ver}_LIBRARY=#{py_lib}/libpython2.7.#{dylib}"
args << "-DPYTHON#{py_ver}_INCLUDE_DIR=#{py_prefix}/include/python2.7"
with

args << "-DPYTHON_LIBRARY=#{py_prefix}/lib/libpython2.7.dylib"
args << "-DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=#{py_prefix}/include/python2.7"
then

5.
 brew install --fresh -vd snappy leveldb gflags glog szip lmdb homebrew/science/opencv

brew install --build-from-source --with-python --fresh -vd protobuf
brew install --build-from-source --fresh -vd boost boost-python

6. Download Caffe
git clone https://github.com/BVLC/caffe.git

cd caffe

cp Makefile.config.example Makefile.config

7. Assure to review Makefile.config to changes suit to your needs
For me, I had to comment the default python path, and use the Ananconda python paths: line 68-71, line 80
uncomment line 8, since only CPU can be used

8. in cmd, find the caffe path( in my case, in Documents/Software/caffe, and type the following template
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/caffe/python:$PYTHONPATH

9. Make and test
make clean

make all -j8

make test

make runtest

make pycaffe

make distribute(?) I didn't run this line
